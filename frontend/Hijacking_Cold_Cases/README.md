# Whodunit 

Whodunit is an interactive mystery-solving game where players take on the role of a digital detective solving cold cases. Built with Django and React, the app simulates digging through case files, opening drawers, and collecting clues on a virtual detective's desk.

##  Tech Stack

- Django REST Framework
- PostgreSQL
- React Router (planned)
- JWT authentication (planned)

##  Features

- User Sign-Up & Login
- Dynamic difficulty levels
- Randomized cold case generation (planned)
- Limited attempts ("lives") per case
